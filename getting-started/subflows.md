# Using subflows

When a flow contains a large number of actions, it may be split up into subflows, making it more manageable and easier to maintain.
- Subflows can be used to organize a flow's actions, but they also allow the reuse of parts of the flow, which helps to avoid cluttering by copy-pasted actions.
